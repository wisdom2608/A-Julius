🚀 **About Me**

I'm a passionate **AWS DevOps Engineer** based in *Buea, Cameroon*.

With focus on building robust, scalable, secure, and automated infrastructure for web applications.

I specialize in:
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using **Terraform**

I strive to create resilient systems (pipelines) that enable faster, safer software delivery.

Currently, I’m advancing my expertise in **AWS services**, **Kubernetes**, and working on **DevSecOps** projects.

I love solving problems, collaborating with teams to move from manual processes to fully automated workflows.
